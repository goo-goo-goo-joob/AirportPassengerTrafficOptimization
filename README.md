# Airport passenger traffic optimization
Algorithm for finding the optimal number of service personnel in each node of the airport network.

`main.py` - the code for performing calculations using the proposed algorithm and the brute-force search.

`utils.py` - the additional code with formulas.

`test_benchmark.py` - the code for benchmark testing implemented in `main.py` methods.

`intensity_plot.py` - the airport traffic data visualization.

`simulational_model.py` - the code for modeling the functioning of the airport (experiment example).
